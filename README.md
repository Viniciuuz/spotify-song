# spotify-song

Flask server to show what you're currently listening to on Spotify. Tested on OBS 30.0.2, should work on all (or at least recent) versions of OBS.

### Theme
I tried to re-create Spotify's look, you can edit the ```index.html``` file to make it look the way you want. Tailwind used for styling
